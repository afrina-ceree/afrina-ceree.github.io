I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Malaya and a research assistant at the School of Computer Science, Peking University. I am fortunate to have closely collaborated with [Prof. Hao Tang](https://ha0tang.github.io) during my undergraduate studies. 

I am eager to contribute to innovative projects in AI Drug Discovery (AIDD) or computational biology and welcome discussions regarding internship opportunities and industry collaborations. If you are interested in learning more, I am available for a brief 10â€“15 minute meeting to share my insights. Please feel free to reach out to me at. [otiswzx@outlook.com](otiswzx@outlook.com)
